      'Our tutor, Tianna Johnson, has been superb in helping grow my daughter’s self-confidence in pre-algebra substantially, as well as her focus and motivation to work. Also, preparing for tests is less stressful for my daughter and for me, too! Tianna is a great role model and demonstrates key traits such as strong patience and organization. We look forward to continuing to work with her.',

      'Vicki Perry has been doing a great job tutoring my son on his reading and writing abilities. She really cares about her students and is truly an educator. As Vicki is fair and sensitive to my son’s needs, she has helped improve his self-esteem and confidence tremendously. Also, she goes the extra mile by working with my son’s teachers to target areas for tutoring. I am very pleased!',

      'Study Wizards has provided my three children with excellent tutors in pre-calculus and Spanish. My children were performing poorly in these classes until we started working with the Study Wizards’ tutors. Their tutors are not only well-educated in the subject matter, but also they know how to explain the key concepts and work with my children to ensure understanding. After each session, the tutors keep me informed about how my children are doing and suggestions for continued study and improvement.',

      'I just wanted to let you know that Emily’s semester report card came, and she earned a solid B in Science. This is a regular-ed Science class, with aide support, but it’s not a modified program grade. She was thrilled! We are very proud of Emily, because we know how hard she worked and studied. She benefited greatly from the support of Emily Hortenstine’s tutoring — she could not have done it without her. We feel very blessed to have Emily H in our lives twice a week. Her upbeat attitude is refreshing. As I listen to her explain things to (my) Emily, I realize she’s teaching studying techniques that we’ve all said before, but somehow, Emily takes it to heart when it’s Emily H talking! I’m very happy that we were able to find your Study Wizards service and look forward to more tutoring support in the future.',

      'Our tutor built a great relationship with our son and his teachers and knew just what to do to help him focus on his schoolwork. He worked with our son’s strengths and weaknesses to develop his study habits and to improve his overall grades. We greatly appreciate having had such a wonderful role model and mentor for our child.',

      'Working with my high school daughter in both algebra and world history, our tutor, Justin Wirth, patiently helped her to develop an effective approach for doing homework and provided her with strategies for each step of writing her research paper. As a result, she received good grades and her self-assurance increased. With tutoring, I am no longer in the equation of working with my daughter nightly, and this has reduced both my daughter’s and my stress. Justin was an outstanding tutor, and we look forward to working with Study Wizards again this school year.',

      'I expected a tutor would assist in getting my son to finish some homework assignments, explain geometry, and untangle algebra. What I did not expect was that my son would find someone who — besides making clear the Pythagorean Theorem — is willing to assist with pragmatic speech and socialization skills. My son looks forward to the sessions, has found a positive role model, and is invigorated and enthused again. I think he is back on track to graduate.',

      'Thank you, Study Wizards, for setting up a very successful summer math study program for my grandson. He was overwhelmed and unable to get organized because he has ADHD. Your choice of tutor was excellent. My grandson and he worked extremely well together and successfully completed a review of the 6th grade math curriculum in 8 weeks in a relaxed environment. The school administrators have reviewed the tutor’s progress report and will now give my grandson additional support.',
