    "p1": "The SAT and ACT are the two tests on every college-bound teenager’s mind as soon as they enter their junior year. While college applications don’t boil down to a single test score, having a good score on these tests is still very important in the college admissions process. Whether taking one test or both, it’s crucial to have a study plan for the months prior to the actual test. Here are the top things to think about while preparing for these notorious standardized tests.",
    "p2": "Both tests contain different sections and testing times, and it’s crucial to be familiar with these formats before taking the test. The most recent version of the SAT has two main sections: Evidence Based Reading & Writing(EBRW) and Mathematics.There is also an optional essay section.The EBRW section involves two subsections.The reading subsection lasts 65 minutes and consists of 52 multiple - choice questions, and the writing subsection lasts 35 minutes and consists of 44 multiple - choice questions.These questions test comprehension, vocabulary, the expression of ideas, and argument formation.Likewise, the Mathematics section is broken down into two parts.A 25 - minute “no calculator” section and a 55 - minute “calculator allowed” section.They consist of 20 and 38 questions, respectively. The ACT is different.It’s comprised of four multiple - choice sections—English(75 questions, 45 minutes), Math(60 questions, 60 minutes), Reading(40 questions, 35 minutes), and Science(40 questions, 35 minutes) —and an optional 40 - minute essay.The Math, English, and Reading sections are similar to the SAT, but the Science section focuses on data analysis and interpretation.This section is a boon for some students but a blow to others.",
    "p3": "Probably unlike many of your child’s tests in school, the SAT and ACT don’t penalize for wrong or skipped answers. Only correct answers add up to their composite score. This means that if a question is especially hard, it’s best to skip it, come back to it later and if need be make one’s best guess. Getting as many questions right as possible should be the main goal for SAT and ACT testers. The SAT is scored out of 1600, with the optional essay scored on a scale from 2 to 8. The maximum score on the ACT is a 36, with the essay scored on a 2 to 12 scale.The average SAT score sits around a 1060, with the ACT national average at about 21.",
    "p4": "There are thousands of practice tests in study books and online. Many high schools even proctor PSATs sometime during sophomore or junior year. It’s a great idea to have your student take at least one practice test to predict their base score and see what areas need the most improvement. For instance, your teen might score a 1250 on a practice SAT and have a significantly higher Math score, while they may also have a high Math score on the ACT, but score closer to 21, the national average.This signals two things.One, that they should be reviewing their English and Reading skills, and two, that they’re likely to score higher on the SAT than the ACT.After this, it’s possible to set a study plan and shoot for a concrete score—a 1400, say.",
    "p5": "Since the SAT and ACT don’t penalize for wrong answers, answering as many questions as possible is a key success factor. Answering more than one question per minute is a challenge, but with repetition and practice, it’s something test takers can get better at over time. Using process of elimination, educated guesses, and being willing to skip over hard questions and return to them later will keep SAT and ACT students from leaving too many questions unanswered."

      "There are plenty of pizza places that would love nothing more than to lay claim to discovering or better yet, deeply understanding the trick of bending the edges of pizza slice towards each other to achieve a straight line from crust through the tip to your mouth. But it ends up that a 19th century mathematician went there almost 100 years ago.",
      "At the time of his discovery, Carl Friedrich Gauss wasn’t thinking about tossing dough in the air, but he did come up with the Theorema Egregium (Latin for “remarkable theorem”) that mathematically defines the curvature of a particular surface in a way that won’t change when you bend that same surface.",
      "If you’ve ever held a piece of pizza by bending the two edges of crust in towards each other and “folding” what was a flat triangle into itself to stabilize the piece, rather than having it flopped all over the place, you’ve practiced this same principle without even realizing it. To further illustrate the principle itself, think about taking a blank 8.5” x 11” piece of paper, then roll it up along its shorter width into a cylinder and place it so it sits 11” high on a flat table. The formerly flat surface has now become a cylindrical surface, but its properties really haven’t changed. If you envision microscopic little ants marching up and down on the surface of the cylinder, perpendicular to the table, you’d be able to clearly delineate an infinite amount of “flat surfaces” they could walk across – even while it was in its cylindrical shape.",
      "Gauss had the mind and the insight to define the curvature of the surface that takes all of those infinite “flat surfaces” into account. Starting at any point – literally any point – an individual could find the two most extreme paths along that surface (the most concave and the most convex pathways) and then multiply the two curvatures of those paths together. The number you would arrive at, in this case with a cylinder, zero, is the very definition of that curvature as defined by the principle pioneered by Carl Friedrich Gauss, or its Gaussian curvature used in differential geometry. The sphere pictured above has positive curvature and the curved cylinder has negative curvature. Gaussian curvatures remains the same no matter how objects are positioned in 3-D space. Enjoy your pizza…"
